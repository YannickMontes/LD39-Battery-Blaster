# BATTERY BLASTER

Game made in 72h hours during the Ludum Dare 39 edition. The theme was *Running out of power*.

![GAME.jpg](/Assets/Warning/UI/GAME.jpg)

In **BATTERY BLASTER**, you're the most **BADASS** war machine. The most **POWERFULL** one in the entire universe.

With **INSANE** weapons such as :
- **Blaster rafale**
- **MEGA BLASTER**
- **PLASMA GRENADE Launcher**

The only issue is that your battery won't follow such **POWER** and will be soon very low.

Fortunately, you have your **AWESOME DYNAMO** charger to get your full power back.

Manage your energy to kill your enemies, survive and fufil your duty. **However, be careful when you are using the dynamo, because you can't do anything else**

## Your mission

*"Hello my friend. There is a very bad guy in this base. Please look for him and kicks his nuts...
Oh, before I forget, you won't be able to damage him until you destroy the 3 energetic pillars that power his shield."*

Find and destroy the **3 pillars** -> **kill the bad guy** -> GG you win
